<h1>Reconcile</h1>
<P>
The reconcile, or verification of transactions using your bank statement is done manually in HomeBank. 
</p>

<h2>:: How the reconcile should be done ?</h2>
<p>
To start, your bank balance must be the last reconcile that you did with the previous bank statement.
</p>
<p>
Then you will validate each transaction and normally you have the bank balance of Homebank which 
correspond to the one of your statement.
</p>

<h2>:: What to do if the balance are not equals ?</h2>

<P>
If balances are not equal at the end of the reconcile, measure the gap. Then transactions have changed are 
identified through the small icon which indicates they have been edited.
</p>
<p>
Though you do not see visually, the filter may help.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it is sometimes easier to go back and start reconcile at the beginning.
