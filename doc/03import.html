<h2><A NAME="assistant"></A>:: The import assistant</h2>

</P>

<h3>Step 1: Introduction</h3>
<P>
This step is a simple introduction page
</P>

<h3>Step 2: Select a file</h3>
<P>You must select a file here, HomeBank will tell you if you can
import that file or not:
</P>
<P>If the file is supported:<BR><IMG SRC="images/00import1.png">
</P>
<P>If the file is not supported:<BR><IMG SRC="images/00import2.png">
</P>


<h3>Step 3: Control the import</h3>
<h4>File information</h4>
	<P>
	In this section, you have information about the file you just selected for import. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The name of the file is recalled, and you'll also have a count of items contained 
	in that file, such as the number of accounts, transactions, payees and categories.
	</P>
<h4>Account to import</h4>
	<div class="gtkshot"><IMG SRC="images/03import3b.png"></div>
	<P>
	In this section, you control the accounts to be imported.
	</p>
	<p>
	Generally, with the 
	files in QIF and OFX format, HomeBank merge the new transactions to already existing accounts. 
	However, some QIF or all CSV files have no information that will identify the account to import to, 
	and you will manage it manually.
	</P>
	<p>
	HomeBank is based on the account number to identify accounts of import files and compares them 
	to those already existing, as well you should update this information carefully in existing accounts.	
	</p>
	<div class="clear"></div>
<h4>Transactions to import</h4>	
	<div class="gtkshot"><IMG SRC="images/03import4.png"></div>
	<P>
	In this section, you control the transactions to be imported.
	</p>
	

	<P>
	HomeBank is to detect the duplicate of each import transaction. A dual operation is visually 
	indicated by a symbol in the list and is in disabled state, which means it will not be imported.
	The transactions or duplicated are listed in the "Duplicate transaction found".
	</p>
	<p>
	You can change the parameters to find those duplicates in real time.
	The detection is done in the following order: account, amount, and date according to the defined tolerance (default is 0 days).
	</P>
	
		<div class="clear"></div>
<h3>Step 4: Update your accounts</h3>
<p>
This last step will show the synthesis of which will be imported.
</p>
<p>
The number of accounts to be imported and / or updated.<br>
The number of transaction to be imported, rejected and the one for which automatic assignment was done for payee and/or category.
