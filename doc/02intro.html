<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>HomeBank was originally think to replace a manual accounting
process; with a pen, a book and a calculator.<BR>Some people uses a
spreadsheet program, but this kind of software is too much general to
easily cover every aspect of a personal accounting.
</P>
<P>HomeBank was written to replace and improve this manual process in
these ways:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI> ease the manual transactions
	insert with a kind of bookmark

	<LI> automate recurrent transactions
	insert with optional anticipation

	<LI> foresee the situation of your
	finance with the future balance

	<LI> provide powerful real time analysis tools to know exactly
	where your money comes and go

</UL>
<P>With such axes, HomeBank can help in seeing if you can spend
extras money each month, or more globally if you can start a more
expensive buy with for example a consumer credit.
</P>
<P>OFX/QFX files import is supported since HomeBank v3.2.<BR>This
format is the most common format of private banks organization.<BR><BR>QIF
files import is supported since HomeBank v4.0.
</P>
<P>At last, HomeBank is not only open source, it intend to be open to
user suggestions and feature requests, so feel free to ask and
suggest !
