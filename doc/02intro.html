<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
HomeBank was originally thinked to replace a manual accounting process; with a pen, a book and a calculator.<br>
Some people uses a tabbler, but this kind of software is too much general to easily cover every aspect of a
personal accounting.
</p>

<p>
HomeBank was written to replace and improve this manual process in these ways:
<ul>
	<li>ease the manual transactions insert with a kind of bookmark
	<li>automate recurrent transactions insert with optional anticipation
	<li>foresee the situation of your finance with the future balance
	<li>provide powerfull realtime analysis tools to know exactly where your money comes and go
</ul>

<p>
With such axes, HomeBank can help in seeing if you can spend extras money each month, or more globally if you 
can start a more expensive buy with for example a consumer credit.
</p>

<p>
OFX/QFX files import is supported since HomeBank v3.2.<br>
This format is the most common format of private banks organisation.<br>
<br>
Another evolution should be to support QIF format, but it become quite obsolete, so if I have enough demands I will think
about it.
</p>

<p>
At last, HomeBank is not only open source, it intend to be open to user suggestions and feature requests, 
so feel free to ask and suggest !
