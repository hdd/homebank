<h2><A NAME="assign"></A>:: Automatic assignment of payee/category</h2>
<P>
This feature allows you to assign a payee and / or category from a word found in the Description field.
</p>
<p>
Note, however, HomeBank will affect if and only if the payee and the category are both empty.
</p>
<p>
There is a new dialog box called Assignments in which you create rules that will be used to automatically assign.<br>
This automatic assignment comes at a time you import a file, or you can trigger it manually from the Accounts window.
</p>

<!-- = = = = separator = = = = -->

<h2><A NAME="paymode"></A>:: New payment mode</h2>
<P>
HomeBank 4.1 introduce some more payment mode:
<ul>
	<li>Debit card</li>
	<li>Standing order</li>
	<li>Electronic payment</li>
	<li>Deposit</li>
	<li>Financial institution fee</li>
</ul>
</P>

<!-- = = = = separator = = = = -->
<h2><A NAME="move"></A>:: Move for payee and category</h2>
<P>
This feature allows to replace a payee/category by another. This will allow you to simply rearrange the payees and the categories.
</p>
<p>
For example, you have a payee "My old payee" and you want to change it to a new payee called "My new payee":<br>
When you use the move feature, HomeBank replace the old with the new value in all transactions, then delete the old value.
</P>

<!-- = = = = separator = = = = -->
<h2><A NAME="import"></A>:: Import process is more simple</h2>
<P>
HomeBank import Assistant now consist of only 3 steps instead of 6.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The introduction page</li>
		<p>This page must be kept to follow the rules of the Gnome HIG</p>
	<li>The file selection page</li>
		<p>no changes on this page</p>
	<li>The import control page</li>
		<p>3 steps were merged into this single page and you can now:
		<ul>
			<li>view the file information</li>		
			<li>control the account to import</li>		
			<li>control the transactions to import</li>	
		</ul>
		But you can also trust HomeBank and go directly to the confirmation page.
		</p>
	<li>The confirmation page</li>
		<p>This page is now more readable, and gives details on what will be chnaged in your account, following the import.</p>
</ol>

</P>

<!-- = = = = separator = = = = -->
<h2><A NAME="filter"></A>:: Filter on plain text for info/description/tag field</h2>
<P>Now you can filter the transactions on a criterion of plain text for the following fields: 
<ul>
<li>description</li>
<li>info</li>
<li>tag</li>
</ul>

<P>
This was a so long missing feature since the Linux port from the Amiga version.
</P>
