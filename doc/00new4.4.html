<h1>New features in v4.4</h1>
<UL class="toc">
	<LI> <A HREF="#balance">Balance report</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="#intxfer">Internal transfer</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="#vehicost">Vehicle cost</A>
</UL>

<h2><A NAME="balance"></A><!-- = = = = separator = = = = -->:: Balance report</h2>
<P>
I have rewritten the overdrawn report and renamed to Balance report. Now you can track your balance for each account
individuallly, but also for all your accounts at a time.
</p>
<p>There is also an option to show every day, so you can see the real balance evolution during time.
By default only days with a changed balance are displayed.<p>
<p>As the operation has disapeared from the listview, I have added, like in other report, a detail feature to 
display the transaction related to a secific day.
</p>

<h2><A NAME="intxfer"></A><!-- = = = = separator = = = = -->:: Internal transfer</h2>
<p>
I have also rethinked and rewritten the internal transfer management.</p>
<p>the first improvement to this is that you should no more encounter sync problems with internal transfer</p>
<p>the second cover the case were you import your file and then change the paymode to internal xfer. HomeBank was
faultly create a new transaction in that case, this is no more, it will try to be smart and detect an existing transfer 
target transaction, and if not, it will show you a list a transactions to choose or let you decide to create a target transaction.</p>




<h2><A NAME="vehicost"></A><!-- = = = = separator = = = = -->:: Vehicle cost</h2>
<P>
The car cost was renamed vehicle cost.</p>
<p>I have fixed a long time problem by adding support for a partial refuel. Now you can (and must) enter your refuel with:<br>
<ul>
	<LI>d=xxxxxx the odometer at refuel time
	<LI>v=xx.xx  the fuel volume for a <b>full refuel</b>
	<LI>v~xx.xx  the fuel volume for a <b>partial refuel</b>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Also I added a new report data with distance by volume (km/l or miles/gal)</p>
